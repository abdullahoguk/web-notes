##Javascript

* Adding javascript to page
`<script>document.write("<p>Hello</p>")</script>`
or `<script src = "js/myscript.js"></script>`
* `==` sign compares equality of values of two variables and also return true even if they have different types.
* Unlike two equal sign, `===` compares equality of types and values of two variables.
* putting `;` at the end of statements is not required but suggested. 
* **Type Casting**
    * String > Number `Number("85")`
    * Number > String `String(85)` or `85 + ""`
